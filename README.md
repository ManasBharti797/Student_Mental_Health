# Student Mental Health Management System
# project overview
This Spring Boot MVC project provides a structured mental health support system for students. It enables secure student registration, profile management, and appointment booking with doctors. The admin panel allows efficient management of students, doctors, and appointments. Built with Spring Boot, JSP, MySQL, and JPA, the system ensures seamless backend operations and a responsive frontend. Students can view, update, and cancel appointments, while doctors manage their schedules. The system enhances accessibility, ensuring timely mental health support.
